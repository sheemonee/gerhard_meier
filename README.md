# Gerhard Meiers Die Toteninsel
This is a student project, which was realised at the University of Berne. Dr. Laurent Pugin taught the course 'Introduction to Digital Data and Digital Editions' and this project is an implementation of some of the learnt techniques. The whole project is conducted in German only, as the author's work was written in German as well. The team consists of Felicitas Senoner (Feesenoner on github) and Simone Kuster (sheemonee). 

This mini-edition is bootstrap-based and shows Gerhard Meiers use of intertextuality in his "Amrainer Tetralogie". As this is just an exampel of how one could go about visualising his collages, his first novel out of four is the only one being represented. Toteninsel. With permission of the Swiss Literature Archives (SLA) in Berne, we uploaded digitalised newspaper pages and created an image-map with links to the various part-of-text. The publisher (Zyytglogge Verlag) as well as the family all give their additional permission for usage of the quoted text and the go-ahead for this project. Therefore, we were able to provide a parallel view of the newspaper quotes and the novel's excerpts. 

Have fun browsing through this Swiss authors work and his intertextuality!
